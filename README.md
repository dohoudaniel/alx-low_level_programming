## Low Level Programming
In this repository, I learn how to write Bash scripts, code and build in C and Bash for lower-level programming. With my ALX Software Engineering Program, I am currently expanding my programming skills by studying a lower-level language to be hard-coded as a Software Engineer, especially in C.

Here are a lists of concepts covered in this concept:
+ C - Hello World
+ C - Variables, If, Else, While
+ C - Functions, Nested Loops
+ C - Debugging
+ C - More Functions, Nested Loops
+ C - Pointer, Arrays, Strings
+ C - Recursion
+ C - Static Libraries
+ C - Variable Arguments ( argc, argv )
+ C - Memory Allocation And Manipulation ( malloc, free )
+ C - Preprocessor
+ C - Structures, Type Definition
+ C - Function Pointers
+ C - Variadic Functions
+ C - Singly Linked Lists
+ C - Bit Manipulation
+ C - File Input / Output
+ C - Doubly Linked Lists
+ C - Dynamic Libraries
+ C - Hash Tables
+ C - Sorting Algorithms
